It should be more along the lines of “save the president’s daughter” or “escape this weird wacky sinister place” NOT “get an artifact that literally controls reality”. Seriously, don’t make me fetch an artifact. Don’t make me fetch anything, make me DO something. 2. Babes. I need pretty girls. 3. The entry. I need to lose consciousness in order to begin my journey in my desired reality, preferably by having it knocked out by one of the aforementioned babes, preferably like a stunning seductive flirty enchantress goddess type. She should do this before I am in the other reality and instead in between somewhere. 4. Action. It needs to be cool. 5. Unconsciousness.

Please spot mistakes, complete/add on my code to make it better and acquaint the requirements in the assignment below:\nScenario\n You are contracted to develop a home appliance rental application for a local startup company. The renting business company provides affordable rental services for people looking to hire home electrical appliances from small to large for a minimum period starting from ONE (1) month. Examples of types of appliances are TV, fridge, freezer, washing machine, dryer, dishwasher, microwave, etc.\n\nThe application should have TWO (2) types of users which are administrator and customer. An administrator can view, add, edit, and delete an item. A customer can create an account with a username and password. The usernames can only contain letters and numbers. The password must be of length between EIGHT (8) and SIXTEEN (16) characters and contain at least ONE (1) lowercase and ONE (1) uppercase letter. A customer can search, view, and order an item after they successfully log in the application.\n\nYour program should include the following requirements. Functional Requirements:\n ● Customers can register.\n ● Customers can search appliances by type and view sorted appliances by energy consumption (see the table below for some common appliances, or research for your chosen appliances) or weekly cost. They can also add appliance items to a shopping cart. \n● Calculation of the total price.\n ● Administrators can add, edit and delete appliance items. \n● Log in page for customers and administrators. Appropriately handle the situation when a reasonable number of failed login attempts occur.\n\nTABLE: \nAppliance\tPower Usage\tTypical Usage\tEstimated annual running costs\nLCD TV\t0.21kWh per hour\t6 hours a day (power on)\t£130\nFridge Freezer (A spec)\t408kWh per year\t24 hours a day\t£115\nTumble Dryer\t2.50kWh per cycle\t148 uses a year\t£105\nElectric hob\t0.71kWh per use\t424 uses a year\t£85\nElectric oven\t1.56kWh per use\t135 uses per year\t£60\nDishwasher\t1.44kWh per use (at 65⁰C)\t135 uses per year\t£55\nKettle\t0.11kWh per use based on heating 1 litre of water\t\t1,542 uses per year\t£48\n\n\n\nNon-functional Requirements:\n● Provide FIVE (5) types of appliances of your choice. \n● Each type has TEN (10) appliances. \n● Each appliance is rented for a monthly fee. \n● Each appliance should have an appropriate description, such as brand, model, dimensions, colour, energy consumption, monthly fee etc. \n● All FIVE (5) types of appliances should have different minimum rental contract periods starting from ONE (1) month.\n ● The application users are customers and administrators. \n● Provide appropriate errors and help messages, and guidance for customer\n\nTASK\na) You need to write code (written in C#) which fulfils all the requirements as outlined above. \nb) The quality of your program will be assessed in terms of program structure, OOP principles in-cluding encapsulation, algorithms using appropriate control structures (loops and selections), and readability including appropriate comments\n\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNOTE: USERS AND APPLIANCES ARE ALL STORED IN ACESS DATABASE WHICH IS CONNECTED TO MY PROJECT\n\nForm1.cs(Login page):\nusing System;\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\nusing System.ComponentModel;\nusing System.Data;\nusing System.Drawing;\nusing System.Linq;\nusing System.Runtime.Remoting.Lifetime;\nusing System.Text;\nusing System.Threading.Tasks;\nusing System.Windows.Forms;\nusing System.Data.OleDb;\nusing static System.Windows.Forms.VisualStyles.VisualStyleElement.Button;\n\nnamespace ApplianceRental\n{\n    public partial class Form1 : Form\n    {\n        \n\n        public Form1()\n        {\n            InitializeComponent();\n            OleDbConnection con = new OleDbConnec-tion(\"Provider=Microsoft.Jet.OLEDB.4.0;Data Source=db_users.mdb\");\n            OleDbCommand cmd = new OleDbCommand();\n            OleDbDataAdapter da = new OleDbDataAdapter();\n            \n        }\n        //connects to database\n        OleDbConnection con = new OleDbConnec-tion(\"Provider=Microsoft.Jet.OLEDB.4.0;Data Source=db_users.mdb\");\n        OleDbCommand cmd = new OleDbCommand();\n        OleDbDataAdapter da = new OleDbDataAdapter();\n        private void Form1_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)\n        {\n            \n        }\n\n        private void button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)\n        {\n            // Validate username and password \n            string username = textBox1.Text;\n            string password = textBox2.Text;\n\n            // Check user type (Administrator or Customer) and redirect ac-cordingly\n            if (username == \"Admin123\" && password == \"stcmalta\")\n            {\n                // Open the Admin Dashboard form\n                AdminDashboardForm adminDashboardForm = new AdminDashboard-Form();\n                adminDashboardForm.Show();\n                this.Hide();\n            }\n            else\n            {\n                con.Open();\n                string login = \"SELECT * FROM tbl_users WHERE username = '\" + textBox1.Text + \"' and password= '\" + textBox2.Text + \"'\";\n                cmd = new OleDbCommand(login, con);\n                OleDbDataReader dr = cmd.ExecuteReader();\n                if (dr.Read() == true)\n                {\n                    new CustomerDashboardForm().Show();\n                    this.Hide();\n                }\n                \n                else\n                {\n                    // Show error message for invalid username or password.\n                    MessageBox.Show(\"Invalid username or password!

The directions are “NORTH”, “SOUTH”, “WEST”, “EAST”. Clearly “NORTH” and “SOUTH” are opposite, “WEST” and “EAST” too. Going one direction and coming back the opposite direction is a wasted effort, so let’s concise these directions to go the shortest route.\n\nFor example, given the following directions:\n\nplan = [“NORTH”, “SOUTH”, “SOUTH”, “EAST”, “WEST”, “NORTH”, “WEST”]\nYou can immediately see that going “NORTH” and then “SOUTH” is not reasonable, better stay to the same place!\nSo the task is to reduce a simplified version of the plan. A better plan in this case is simply:\n\nplan = [“WEST”]\nOther examples:\nIn [“NORTH”, “SOUTH”, “EAST”, “WEST”], the direction “NORTH” + “SOUTH” is going north and coming back right away. What a waste of time! Better to do nothing. The path becomes [“EAST”, “WEST”], now “EAST” and “WEST” annihilate each other, therefore, the final result is [] (nil in Clojure).\nIn [“NORTH”, “EAST”, “WEST”, “SOUTH”, “WEST”, “WEST”], “NORTH” and “SOUTH” are not directly opposite but they become directly opposite after the reduction of “EAST” and “WEST” so the whole path is reducible to [“WEST”, “WEST”].\n\nTask\nYou have to write a function dirReduc which will take an array of strings and returns an array of strings with the needless directions removed (W<->E or S<->N\nside by side).\n\nThe Haskell version takes a list of directions with data Direction = North | East | West | South. The Clojure version returns nil when the path is reduced to nothing.\n\nSpecification\ndir_reduc(directions)\nParameters\ndirections: Array (of Strings) - An array with each index containing 1 of the 4 cardinal directions, all in uppercase\n\nReturn Value\nArray (of Strings) - The optimized set of instructions\n\nExamples\ndirections Return Value\n[“NORTH”,“SOUTH”,“SOUTH”,“EAST”,“WEST”,“NORTH”,“WEST”] [“WEST”]\n[“NORTH”,“SOUTH”,“SOUTH”,“EAST”,“WEST”,“NORTH”] []\n[“NORTH”,“WEST”,“SOUTH”,“EAST”] [“NORTH”,“WEST”,“SOUTH”,“EAST”]\nNote\nNot all paths can be made simpler.\n\nThe path [“NORTH”, “WEST”, “SOUTH”, “EAST”] is not reducible. “NORTH” and “WEST”, “WEST” and “SOUTH”, “SOUTH” and “EAST” are not directly opposite of each other and can’t become such. Hence the result path is itself : [“NORTH”, “WEST”, “SOUTH”, “EAST”].\n\n\nYour solution:\n\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef reduce_directions(directions: List[str]) -> List[str]:\n\nreturn []", "target_text": null, "duration": 30.0}
