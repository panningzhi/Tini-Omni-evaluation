At the next turnstile they overtook some women carrying market baskets loaded with vegetables and other things to sell. \"Look at the old fool,\" Exclaimed one of them. \"Perched on the ass, while that poor boy has to walk.\"The miller felt a bit vexed, but to be agreeable he told the boy to climb up behind him. They had no sooner started out again than a loud shout went up from another company of people on the road. \"What a crime,\" Cried one, \"To load up a poor dumb beast like that! they look more able to carry the poor creature, than he to carry them.\"\"They must be on their way to sell the poor thing's hide,\" Said another. The miller and his son quickly scrambled down, and a short time later, the market place was thrown into an uproar as the two came along carrying the donkey slung from a pole. A great crowd of people ran out to get a closer look at the strange sight. The ass did not dislike being carried, but so many people came up to point at him and laugh and shout, that he began to kick and bray, and then, just as they were crossing a bridge, the ropes that held him gave way, and down he tumbled into the river. The poor miller now set out sadly for home. By trying to please everybody, he had pleased nobody, and lost his ass besides. ", "target_text": "If you try to please all, you please none.

Intrigued, she demanded to see whoever it was who had offered this gift. Despite her curiosity, she pretended to be highly offended by the gift when the young man was brought before her.

Finally, all the animals were laughing at the invisible leon, calling him things like: \"The lion that barks but doesn't bite\", \"The king with no subjects\" Or \"The phantom lion king, the one that does nothing\"…and thus ended mozzie's golden days of happiness; the fly that roared, that threatened, that lied so much… so much so that when the time came to keep his word, there was no way he could.

The class members were a bunch of rather mischievous colours; from black and white, through to red and blue, yellow, and all the rest. They hoped to grow up to be wonderful colours, and this is what they were training for. As well as funny and joyful, the colours were very naughty; particularly black and white, who were so preoccupied with causing mayhem that they were almost always late for class. One morning there was a great commotion in the sky. The clouds were up there, practicing their raining, but they had been raining for so long that they'd gone and created a storm so terrible that absolutely everyone had become saddened and depressed at having so little light. When the sun started shining again, not even that managed to cheer up the world. The only solution was to appeal, as a last resort, to the naughty, mischievous colours, even though they were still very young and weren't yet trained for anything like this. The authorities went straight to their classroom. It was still early, and, as ever, black and white hadn't yet turned up. However, there was no time to lose; they couldn't wait for black and white. The other colours had to do something fast. They ran down the corridors, out of the door, and flew up into the sky, where the clouds - ashamed for what had happened - were waiting. On their way up to the clouds each one of the colours left a resplendent trail. Travelling side by side, the combination of all the colours' trails was so striking and spectacular that smiles returned to everyone's face, and the world filled with the sound of applause. The colours felt honoured and delighted to be named as the sun's official assistants. And the inhabitants of the world begged them to promise that, from that day on, the colours would always be on hand, to help cheer everyone up. It was agreed that whenever the clouds overdid it on the rain, the colours would come quickly and make a rainbow. A bit later, black and white entered the classroom, finding it empty. Everyone was congratulating the other colours so much for their wonderful performance that black and white - really the most fun and happy of all the colours - didn't dare to ask to be part of the rainbow, and from that time onward they forced themselves to be punctual and responsible. Indeed, they managed this so well that now they don't mind being left out of the rainbow.

Every year an absent-minded tourist would fall foul of a great big pinch that made them leave and not want to come back. Scared swimmers would often get together to try and catch the crab but every time they thought they had succeeded, the pinches returned to let them know they had caught the wrong crab. Crazyclaws had a mean streak but he was also very clever. Instead of concealing himself and going unnoticed like all the other crabs, he would hide in the sand and prepare his attack. Crazyclaws was a little resentful because, as a baby crab, he was stepped on by a child and had lost a leg. It grew back but it was shorter than his other legs and he got very angry and upset every time he looked at it. He was thinking about how mean swimmers could be when he spotted his next victim. It was a big fat shiny toe and its owner was barely moving. 'how easy! ' he thought. Now he could pinch with all his strength. He remembered the different steps he had to follow: emerge, move forward, pinch, release, retreat, and disappear into the sand again. Go get'em!! Something went wrong, however. Crazyclaws got stuck on the fourth step and was unable to release the toe. His pinch was so strong that he had broken through the skin and got stuck in the flesh. Flesh? It couldn't be, there was no blood. Only then did crazyclaws realise it was a trap! But crazyclaws was exaggerating as always. He thought that no one could be so smart as to trap him with a fake toe. The fake toe did belong to someone though: a girl called vera, who lost her leg in an accident when she was little. She didn't realise that crazyclaws was attached to her toe until she came out of the water to go and play in the sand. She released the crab, but he didn't run off because he was scared to death. Vera discovered that crazyclaws had a shorter leg and she felt sorry for him, so she decided to help him. She made him a wonderful little house using rocks and fetched him small animals to eat. What a feast! This girl sure can look after a crab. She was happy, fun and - most importantly - she put him back in the sea before leaving. \"What a lovely girl\" He thought that night. \"I'd like to be just as nice as her. if only I didn't have this little leg …\". It was at that moment that he realised that vera's leg had never grown back and that children aren't like crabs. They only have two legs and yet she was still really nice. He could certainly be a happy crab even though he had been through very difficult times. The very next day and every day after that during that summer, crazyclaws attacked vera's toe again so he could play with her all day. Together they learned how to turn pinches into tickles and a bad temper into a laughter and glee. In the end, vera's crab became very famous on that beach, though nobody suspected that it was actually crazyclaws. It was better that way because there were still people who had not learnt that you don't need to be resentful and bad tempered, no matter how badly you are pinched by a crab.

However, the archer was never far from his bow and arrows, and the new arrows got to see jerry's terrifying life from close up. They travelled so far at his side that they got to see the sadness and disappointment in the warrior's eyes, and they came to understand that this savage fighter had never seen any other kind of life.

One night he appeared at the rich man's house, with a big smile on his face: \"I found it!\" He said, \"My calculations are perfect.\" The rich man was going on a long journey the next day, and didn't have time to listen. He promised the mathematician he would pay him double his wages if he would take charge of the business while he was away, and put the new formulas into practice. Excited by his new discovery, the mathematician was delighted to accept. When the rich man returned, months later, he found that all of his possessions had gone. Furious, he went to ask for an explanation from the mathematician. The mathematician calmly told him what he had done. He had given everything away to people. The rich man couldn't believe it, but the mathematician explained it further. \"For months I analysed how a rich man could gain the maximum benefit, but what I could do was always limited. there's a limit to how much one man can do by himself. then I understood the key was that many people could help us to achieve the aim. so the conclusion was that helping others was the best way to get more and more people to benefit us.\"Disappointed and furious, the greedy man stormed off, desperate at having lost everything to the hare-brained schemes of a madman. However, while he was walking away disconsolately, several neighbours ran over, worried about him. All of them had been helped when the mathematician shared out the rich man's fortune. They felt so grateful to him that they offered him the hospitality of their houses, and anything such a special man might need. The neighbours even argued over who would get to help him. Over the next few days, he saw the full results of what the mathematician had calculated. Wherever he went he was received with great honour, and everyone was willing to help him in whatever way they could. He realised that his not having anything had given him much, much more. In this way, he managed to quickly set up flourishing businesses, but this time he followed the brilliant mathematician's advice. No longer did he keep his riches in a safe, or anything like it. Instead, he shared out his fortune among a hundred friends, whose hearts he had converted into the safest, most grateful and fruitful of safes.

No one expected her; she was still young and, what's more, she was the mother of two small children. Saint peter looked at her, very seriously. \"And what are you doing here? surely it's not your time yet\". Even so, after checking the ledger, he indeed found her name, but still found it hard to believe. It was true. She had done all the things that allow one to enter into heaven, including leaving her children with everything they would need, and she had managed it all in so little time! On seeing his surprise, tatiana smiled and said,\"I've always done things quickly. ever since adrian and andrea were babies I gave them everything I had, and I kept it in the form of a treasure which only they could access\". Everyone in heaven knew what tatiana was referring to. From day one mothers set to work, filling the hearts of their children with love and virtues. And the rule is that mothers can only go to heaven once they have completely filled their children's hearts. This was amazing news. It was very unusual to hear of children having their hearts filled so soon, and everyone in heaven wanted to investigate. Looking at children's hearts is the favourite pastime of the angels. At night, when children are sleeping, their hearts shine intensely with a purplish light that only angels can see. The angels certainly come to see; they sit around the children, softly singing songs of beauty. And so it was that, that night, in the bedroom of adrian and andrea, thousands of angels gathered. Neither of the children had overcome their grief at their mother's passing, but they were managing to sleep. On falling asleep, their hearts started to light up, as always. Gradually the light became more intense until their hearts shone brilliantly and with unmatched beauty. Without any doubt, tatiana had left their hearts brimming with such love and such virtue that they could have shared these with thousands of other children. The angels gave thanks for a spectacle of such beauty, they sang hymns of praise, and resolved to return each night. On waking, neither adrian nor andrea noticed anything strange, but they did feel filled with a strength to meet the new the day with enthusiasm; ready to grow and learn in the way their mother had always wanted. So, without ever failing to miss their mother, adrian and andrea developed into a pair of wonderful children, overflowing with goodness. Every day they took inspiration from hearts filled with love and virtue, left to them by their mother, and from the nightly presence of thousands of angels who came to see them shine.

When they were finally ready, they travelled by sea to the island of a thousand deserts, crossed its endless sand dunes, climbed the great rock mountain and finally found the fountain. But the fountain was dry. So dry that they could only fill their wands with a tiny drop of magic. And when the magic of the fountain was drained, the island was transformed into an immense desert that no one could cross. Only two small oases remained and, to give themselves the best chance at survival, iplant and ieat decided to go their separate ways, each to their own tiny oasis. Life then became very hard for both of them. Although the oasis provided them with plenty of water, their only food were the dates from the few palm trees that had grown at the water's edge. Although they waved their wands in an attempt to obtain food, they had so little magic that nothing ever happened. Several weeks later, however, ieat waved his wand and a huge, tasty tomato appeared before him. \"Lucky me! if I eat it now, it will make me happy today.\"And that day was ieat's best since he had gone to live in the oasis. A few days later, something similar happened to iplant, when his wand produced a small potato. \"Lucky me! if I plant the potato and take care of it, it will make me happy for many days.\"That day, iplant was just as hungry as before but he also had to work to prepare the soil and plant the potato. Sometime later the wand gave ieat a chubby songbird. \"Lucky me! if I eat it now, it will make me happy today.\" The bird tasted so good that the day turned out to be his best in the oasis. Around that time also, iplant's wand gave him a skinny songbird. \"Lucky me! if I feed the bird and take care of it, it will make me happy for many days.\"For many days after that, iplant shared the little food he had with the bird, to get the bird to return and wake him up every morning with beautiful songs. Every now and again, the two wizards received new little gifts from their wands. Ieat used them at once to enjoy a special day, while iplant put up with hunger and tiredness to turn each gift into something that might be useful in future. That way, it didn't take him long to grow a small garden with fruit, which he shared with more and more animals who provided him with assistance, food and company. Eventually he felt so happy and comfortable, and had so many things, that he finally dared to go out and find ieat to try and cross the desert and escape. However, ieat wanted nothing to do with him. Hearing how iplant had achieved so much and thinking that he could have done the same, he was filled with anger and jealousy. Convinced that everything was because of the little magic in his own wand, he switched it with iplant's when he wasn't looking. Impatient to try his new wand, he ordered his old friend to leave. But the wand had even less magic than the one he already had, and the jealous and impatient magician was stuck in his oasis for years and years, unable to escape. Iplant left ieat's oasis determined to cross the desert. He had only been travelling for a few hours when a strong gust wind dragged his friend, the little bird, away. The wizard ran after him to save him, but the wind turned into a tornado that lifted the little bird, the wizard and all his things, up into the air. They flew and flew for so many hours that they crossed the desert and then crossed the sea. Finally, the wind dropped and iplant landed softly in a peaceful green valley, next to a beautiful fountain. The bird then took iplant's wand in his beak and carried it to the fountain. The young wizard felt the wand and himself fill with the purest magic and the deepest wisdom. He realised that this was the true fountain of magic and that the bird was its faithful guardian, entrusted with the job of saving such great powers for wizards who had sufficient wisdom, patience and willpower to achieve big things with just a tiny drop of magic.

One day, a giant turtle entered the rhino's territory unaware. The rhino quickly ran over to the turtle, with the intention of getting rid of it. The turtle was frightened and withdrew into its shell. When the rhino demanded that the turtle get out of his territory, there was no discernible movement. The rhino was incredibly annoyed; he thought the turtle was fooling him. So he started banging the shell to make the turtle come out. No success, and his blows got increasingly violent. He whacked it with his horn, sending the poor turtle flying in all directions. From a distance, it looked a bit like a solitary game of football, with the turtle as the ball. Quite an amusing spectacle, it was, and a load of monkeys soon gathered close by to enjoy it. They laughed non-stop at the angry rhino and his struggle with the turtle. The rhino was so furious that he didn't even notice that they were there. On he went, until he had to stop for a second to get his breath. Now that he wasn't bashing the shell, he could hear the laughing and joking of the monkeys, who were making fun of him in every way you can imagine.

So, they exchanged a knowing look, nodded, and the turtle went back inside his shell. This time the rhino very quietly retreated a few steps, looked at the turtle, looked at the monkeys, took a run up, and shot the giant turtle, with such a good aim, that it seemed like he was using the monkeys as skittles. The 'strike' against the monkeys turned that place into something of a casualty ward for baboons. There they all lay, covered in cuts and bruises, and not even a smirk crossed their lips.

So much so, that when he saw other robots in the street, he would look at them with a certain air of superiority; he reserved his enthusiastic greetings for other xt-27s. \"All robots should be like us xt-27s\", he thought to himself. He was convinced that no new robot would be able to improve on the xt-27 model, and that the world would be a much better place if all robots were like himself.

Yet the forest was constantly in danger, because a small group of wicked beings came every night to cut down some of the trees. The villagers could do nothing to stop the felling, so they were forced to constantly plant new trees to replace the fallen ones. And for generations, such was life for the tree planters. Parents taught their children how to plant, and the children, from a very early age, spent all their free time planting new trees. Each family was responsible for replanting a particular area, and had been since time immemorial. Failure of any family to do this would have brought the community to ruin. Of course, most of the planted trees were lost due to a thousand varying reasons, and only a small percentage reached full growth. But so many were planted that the protective forest managed to maintain its size, despite the great storms and the cruel felling of the evil beings. But then, there was a great misfortune. One of the families died out due to lack of descendents, and their area of the forest began losing more trees. There was nothing to be done, the tragedy was inevitable, and in the village the people prepared to emigrate after so many centuries. Even so, one of the young men refused to abandon the village. -\"I won't go,\" He said, -\"If needed, I will start a new family that will look after that area, and I myself will go to work on it from day one.\"Everyone knew that no one was capable of looking after a replanting area all on their own and, as the forest would take some time to thin out, they accepted the young man's proposal. Yet, by doing so, they had accepted the greatest revolution ever seen in the village. That young man, loved by all, had no trouble in finding people to help him replant. But those helping hands all came from other areas, and soon his own area wasn't the only one in need of extra help and more trees. These new areas were helped by other families and soon no one knew whether they should look after their own area or someone else's: so to simplify things they just planted trees wherever they were needed. But they were needed in so many areas that the villagers began planting even during the night, despite their ancestral fear of the wicked tree cutters. Those nocturnal plantings meant the planters came across some of the fellers, only to discover that those \"Wicked\" Beings were nothing more than the frightened members of a tribe that hid themselves in the labyrinthine cliff caves during the day. They would surface at night to get some wood and food, so they could survive. As soon as these \"Beings\" Got to see how good it was living in a village on the surface, having food and water, and knowing how to plant trees, they begged to be accepted into the village. With each new night, the village gained more hands to help with the planting, and there were fewer cave-dwellers cutting down the trees. Soon, the village filled with grateful \"Night-beings\" Who mixed happily among the old families until they became indistinguishable. And so great was their influence, that the forest began to expand. Day after day, year after year, almost imperceptibly, the forest got bigger and bigger, and it provided more and more protection, until finally the descendants from that village could live anywhere they liked in the region.

In return, if the king considered that person to be unworthy, he would have their head chopped off. Many risked their lives to challenge the proud king. Rich or poor, stupid or intelligent, the king always found them to be unworthy; they weren't good players, they couldn't match his command of the game. As time passed, one reckless challenger after another was done away with. The king felt satisfied that there was no one in the whole land capable of taking him on. Years later, a poor beggar came to the palace, intending to play against the king. People had tried to dissuade the beggar, trying to save him from a certain death. But it was no good, and he came before the king, who, seeing the beggar's ragged appearance, couldn't believe that it had even crossed the man's mind that he could be a worthy rival. -\"What makes you think you deserve to play against someone like myself, slave?\" Said the king, irritated, and calling for the executioner. -\"That I forgive you for what you're about to do. would you be capable of that?\" The beggar calmly answered. The king was stunned. He would never have expected anything like that. But the more he thought about it, the more the man's words made sense. If he were condemned to death the beggar would be right, and would have shown himself to be the better man due to his capacity to forgive. And if the beggar was not executed, he would come away with both his life and a reputation for being a worthy adversary…without having yet moved a piece, the king knew he had already lost the match. -\"How did you manage to beat me without even playing? whether I play with you or not, everyone will have seen my lack of dignity,\" Said the king, beaten. \"You are mistaken, your majesty. everyone is already aware of your infamy; it is not people who are unworthy, it is their deeds. for years your actions have shown how disgraceful and unjust you have become, judging the worth of others at a whim.\"The king understood how dishonourable he had become, and he became remorseful for his crimes and his arrogance. He looked into the beggar's eyes. The king saw such wisdom and dignity in those eyes that, without saying a word, he handed the beggar his crown, swapped clothes with him, and made him the new king. Dressed in the beggar's rags, and with eyes full of tears, his last command as king was to be imprisoned forever in the deepest dungeon, as a penance for all his crimes. However, the new king was so just and so wise that only a few years later he set the old king free. His sincere repentance had become the best accompaniment to his great intelligence, and from his hands came the best ever laws for that long-suffering kingdom.

One day, they happened upon each other in the forest, and manute was showing pontoma a coral snake he had just caught, when there began a downpour, the likes of which no one had ever seen. They both ran to shelter themselves under some thick foliage, and there they stayed until the rain had stopped. However, when they were about to leave the shelter, they heard the roar of a tiger, at a distance of only a couple of meters.

Both were born from the same big, perfect, dewdrop, and for years they spent their lives together inside the same flower. The problem was that they were so shy that they never wanted to go out into the world. As they didn't know any other fairies, they wondered whether they themselves were beautiful or ugly, intelligent or stupid, fortunate or unlucky. They thought about this so much and so often that they ended up convinced that they were ugly, stupid and unlucky. So much so, that they resolved never to leave their comfortable flower. There they stayed, living their lives regretting their misfortune. How could they show themselves to the world, when they were such a pair of disasters? What would others say about them? And what if others rejected them and ridiculed them? That was, until one day when pionina summoned up enough courage to leave the flower. -\"It's not my fault I'm so horrible,\" She told herself, -\"I will try to be kind and cheerful, and maybe that way they will forgive me my flaws,\" She thought, now determined to venture out.

Seeing this light, hundreds of fairies emerged from their flowers to take it all in. They all watched in admiration as they beheld the most beautiful fairy anyone had ever seen. Before long, there was a huge commotion all around pionina, and in only a few short minutes she had become the most famous of all fairies, thanks to her beauty, her intelligence, and her good fortune. Pionina then hurried off to tell her sister how mistaken they had been for all those years. The problem was, she didn't know the way back to her flower. In that land there were hundreds of thousands of flowers, just like her own. Pionina couldn't tell which one was the one she had lived in. She searched and searched, but could never manage to find fiorina. And there fiorina remained, hidden in her flower, filled with fear, believing herself to be the most horrible of fairies; never knowing that if she ever decided to come out, she would realise that she was the most beautiful and fortunate of all the fairies.

In those gardens there lived thousands of creatures from hundreds of different species. They were of great variety and colour, and they turned that place into a kind of paradise that everyone could enjoy. There was only one thing in those gardens that the king disliked: near the centre stood the remains of what had been, centuries ago, a huge tree, but that now was withered and dry, and detracted from the colour and beauty of its surroundings. This bothered the king so much that he finally ordered it to be cut down and replaced by a beautiful series of fountains. Some time later, a wise noble was visiting the king at his palace. He whispered in the king's ear:   -\"Majesty, you are the wisest of men. everywhere one hears talk of the beauty of these gardens and the multitude of creatures that populate them. but during the time I've spent here, I've hardly seen anything other than this fountain and just a few small birds… what a deception!\"The king, who never tried to deceive anyone, found, to his horror, that what the noble had told him was true. They had spent so many months admiring the fountains that they hadn't realised that hardly any animals remained in the gardens. Without wasting time he sent for the court's experts and advisers. The king had to listen to many lies, inventions and assumptions, but nothing could explain what had happened. Not even the great reward offered by the king managed to recuperate the royal gardens' former splendour. Many years later, a young man presented himself to the king, assuring him that he could explain what had happened, and how the animals could be returned. -\"What happened with your garden is that there just wasn't enough poo, your majesty. particularly moth poo.\"All those present laughed at the young man's joke. The guards got ready to throw him out, but the king stopped them. -\"I want to hear what you have to say. from the thousand lies I've heard, none have begun like that.\"The young man continued, very serious, and started explaining how the gardens' big animals fed mainly on the little brightly-coloured birds, who owed their appearance to their own food, composed of colourful worms, who in turn fed on various rare species of plants and flowers that could only grown in that part of the world, just so long as there was enough moth poo for them… and so he continued, telling how the moths were the basis of much food for many other birds, whose poo encouraged the appearance of new species of plants that fed other insects and animals, and which were, in turn, vital to the existence of other species… and the young man would have kept speaking without pause if the king had not shouted. -\"Enough! and can you tell me how you know all these things, being so young?\" Asked the king. -\"Well, because now all from your garden are at my house. before I was born my father collected that old tree you had torn out from the middle of the garden, and he planted it in our garden. since then, every spring, from out of that tree come thousands and thousands of moths. with time, the moths attracted the birds, and new plants and trees grew, providing food for other animals that, in turn, provided food for others… and now, my father's old place is filled with life and colour. all thanks to the moths from the big old tree.\" -\"Excellent!\" Exclaimed the king, -\"Now I'll be able to recover my gardens. and you, I'll make you rich. rest assured that within a week everything will be ready. use as many men as you like.\" -\"Your majesty, I'm afraid that cannot be,\" Said the young man, -\"If you like I can try to recreate the gardens, but you will not live to see it. it will take many years for the natural balance to reestablish itself. with great good fortune perhaps I, when I'm old, will see it completed. things like these do not depend on how many men work on them.\"The face of the old king was sad and pensive, understanding how delicate was the balance of nature, and how careless it had been to break it so happily. But he so loved those gardens and those creatures that he decided to build a huge palace next to the young man's land.

When night came, after much time spent looking for them, but with no luck, he took refuge in a small cave he found in the mountainside. Inside the cave there were only a few dry twigs and leaves that had been blown their by the wind. Although feeding himself wasn't a worry, seeing as he had always been so good at it, not knowing whether he would see his loved ones again deeply saddened him. -\"Don't stray far from us when we're migrating,\" His parents had always repeated to him. But he would get so excited at all the little things he would discover during their journeys, and there he would be, open-mouthed, contemplating these wonders, flapping his wings over every new treasure, while the others just carried on with the journey, not noticing his absence. That day, while flying, he had seen a flash of light, a reflection coming out of the trees, and without realising it, he swooped low and approached to see what was the source of the beautiful light. And he discovered an enormous, picturesque lake of crystalline waters; a sight that left him completely surprised. -\"Wow!!\" He exclaimed, seeing himself reflected in the water, -\"How wonderful!!\"He'd never seen anything like it. The sun was beginning to fire its rays onto the water, and these became brilliant golden reflections that almost blinded you. It was a spectacular sight. There he played, flying over the water, playing with his own reflection; using the calm waters as a mirror, viewing the white clouds sliding past overhead. Time passed without him realising, and when he gained altitude and called for his family so he could show them what he'd found, his call went unanswered. His parents and brothers and sisters had continued on with the journey, and they couldn't hear him. Suddenly an enormous fear arose in him. All that beauty disappeared from his eyes, and he could only hear strange noises that increased his fear and his feeling of uneasiness. Cries of strange birds echoed around the forest, and everything that had hitherto seemed beautiful turned into something gloomy and ghostly. The sun now seemed to cast only shade, and he was afraid of being left alone in the forest. He flew out of the trees, in search of his family, but the night came and he was still alone. So then he sought out a place to shelter and pass the night. With the little leaves he found in the cave he made a small nest. It was a bit noisy since the leaves were so dry, but at least it gave him some warmth that night. The following day, when he woke, he didn't remember that he'd become lost, but soon after getting up it all came to mind, and he began worrying. -\"Oh, my god! what will I do here alone? where is my family?\" And he soon found out how much he missed them. His parents had always repeated to him that, if someday he should get lost, what he should do is not go far from the last place they had all been together, put himself in a place that was high enough so he could be seen when they returned, and that he should never allow fear to stop him seeing reality. -\"It's true!!\" He said, remembering this, -\"My parents told me what I would have to do if I get lost, so I have nothing to be afraid of. my family is looking for me right now, and soon we'll be together.\"And so he left his little cave, thanking it for having given him shelter that night. Once again everything outside was beautiful, and the confidence that he would find his family made him fly happily in what was an unknown place for him. Before long he once more found the beautiful lake, and there he found the tallest tree, where he perched himself. While he was waiting he began humming, and gradually the little birds who lived there joined in with him. He told them he was lost, and the birds decided to sing really loudly so that anyone passing would hear them. Soon their song could be heard from very far off, and this helped his family to quickly find him. After that day, our little hummingbird was a bit wiser. Now he knew that he should always let his family know when was going to fly off from them during their travels. He also knew that during the course of his life he would meet others who would offer him their help. And, most important of all, he learned that when fear got the better of him the most beautiful things could come to appear the most terrifying.

Taking out words here and there, he was able to finish the stories a little quicker. However, this still didn't seem enough, so he kept shortening them more and more until, one day, he cut out the most important words of a tale: \"The end\". That night he went to bed peacefully but he woke up feeling rather strange. He got up and when he looked in the mirror he realised that he was wearing a big pirate hat and a black eye-patch and had an enormous red beard with white spots! There was no doubt in his mind: he had been transformed into flamenco beard, the notorious pirate captain from his tales. Worried, he ran to his children's bedrooms. As he opened the door, a great wall of water came crashing down on him and he soon found himself swimming in the middle of the sea. He wasn't alone, however. He was being chased by hungry sharks which had not eaten for weeks. Flamenco beard prepared himself to fight, grabbing the butter knife that he always kept hidden under his hat. Just as he was about to lunge at the first shark, he felt himself being lifted into the air and then dropped onto the deck of a giant pirate ship. \"That was close, captain\" - said a pirate sailor who was the spitting image of his eldest son. \"The captain could've dealt with those clumsy sharks!\" Shouted a couple of cabin boys who were so similar flamenco beard could have sworn they were his twins. There was no time to lose. The captain was told that the queen had been kidnapped and there would be a great reward for whoever rescued her safe and sound. Without a second thought, they set sail to the island of the last cannibal, the favourite spot for all baddies wishing to hide kidnapped queens. They were at full sail when a big, dark storm started to form and, as fate would have it, a bolt of lightning struck the mast of the ship, triggering a massive fire. They were so busy putting out the fire that they didn't realise that an enormous wave had hurled the ship onto the reefs around the island with so much force that the captain and his sailors were sent flying into the air. When the captain woke up, he found himself tied to a big tree trunk. His crew of pirates was tied up next to him. They were in the heart of the island's volcano, the place chosen by the cannibals for their sacrifices and rituals. However, they were not the ones who were going to be eaten. Everything had been put in place to sacrifice a beautiful woman with a crown, who had to be the queen. The cannibals started their chants. How annoying, they always did everything while singing. Then the captain had an idea. With a loud voice, he began to sing pirate songs and all the crew joined in singing at the top of their voices. The cannibals tried to sing louder and, even though there were more of them, they couldn't sing louder than the captain and his men. Without their chants, they couldn't begin the feast so, red in the face with anger, they decided to switch the captain for the queen. Now it was the captain who was hanging above a big pot, about to be cooked. He could feel the burning of the pepper and smell the sauce, and he became so hot that he no longer had the strength to sing. His men were silenced also by the big dollops of chocolate ice cream they were eating with relish. How did those savages know that chocolate ice cream was his crew's weakness? Just then he saw the queen smile, a crooked smile that only withered flower possessed. Clearly, it had all been a trap, set by the fearsome woman pirate captain - once his greatest companion but was now his biggest rival - to capture flamenco beard and his men. Surrounded by cannibals and grimacing at the pain of the first bite, the captain accepted defeat. \"You win, withered flower. this is the end.\"On saying that last word, everything disappeared and the daddy found himself in bed, still scared and sweaty. Lying next to him, wearing the same crooked smile as withered flower, his wife gave him a kiss and said: \"Next time you shorten the stories you tell the children, you'll have me to deal with in the cave of madness.\"The daddy lay deep in reflection throughout the night. It had been great fun to be part of the stories but he was also so terrified that he vowed never to cut even a single word from his children's stories again.

Sarah and mark managed to break one of the wizard's tricks, so the wizard decided to get his revenge by using a strange spell which would give all the children a good laugh, before he moved on.

After a while the complaints petered out, and sarah and mark looked at each other. They had finally realised that what the wizard was now doing was exactly what they themselves had been doing all their lives. After they promised not to gossip any more about other people's private lives, the wizard removed the spell and said goodbye to them all.

It was an enchantment that passed from person to person: all you needed was two men, women, children, or old folk to touch each other, and the virus would spread from one to another. The effects of this spell varied according to the disease, but they usually took the form of small magical misfortunes, such as becoming suddenly bald, sneezing out ice cubes, crying out of your feet, or having such sticky hands that it was impossible to let go of anything you'd picked up. It being the case that not everyone touches others with the same frequency, it so happened that some people passed on the magic illness very easily, but others - those with less contact with people - became really seriously ill, particularly when they'd spent more than three days with the virus. Of course, no-one thought these small misfortunes were caused by a virus, and the blame was usually pinned on some mischievous elf or passing witch. Only one doctor from that area - dr. Ivor malady - , began suspecting something, after having contracted the illness over twenty times himself, and almost always after doing his rounds. He began experimenting on his patients and on himself, and within a few days he was certain about how the disease was transmitted. The good doctor called all the townsfolk to a meeting and told them that their illness would last for as long as it took them to touch someone else. And so it was that the town became the world chasing capital. Residents spent much of their time chasing others around the streets, to touch their chosen victim, in order to get rid of the virus. Even the oldest folk joined in the fun, and the people's health improved so much with all the running about that dr. Malady was presented with many prizes and awards. The funniest thing is that the magi-virus moved towns without anyone realising it. It was taken away by a man who came to visit, and bumped into a \"Carrier\" Who was sprinting after some children. On returning to his home town, things were a bit different, and instead of chase, that town became world hugging capital. Everyone who passed that way was given a great big bear hug, along with the magic illness. So it didn't take long for the virus to move on to another town, and in this third town the people ended up spending all hours of the day kissing each other. And so it was, one after another, the magi-virus went around the world, changing people's behaviour wherever it went, making every place more fun and more friendly, leaving everyone feeling closer.

Nor did he realise how difficult it was for other children to get toys like the ones he had. A time came, though, when he was so used to all his toys and various stuff, that he began to want something different. One of his uncles found a fine horse and he gave it to charlie, as something unusual. Charlie was very excited at having a horse. He learned to ride, and was constantly on his horse, going here and there. However, he treated the horse just as badly as he did all his other toys, and it soon started looking neglected and sick. For the first time in his life charlie became truly worried. He loved the horse, and the fact that his family had offered to swap it for a new one meant nothing to him. One day, while in the countryside, he saw a girl with a horse. The girl looked very poor, but the horse seemed happy and looked great. Wondering how she had managed this, charlie secretly followed them, watching everything they did. First he followed them through the forest, where he saw that she never used the whip, and never hit the horse. This was the opposite of what charlie had done to his horse, right from day one. Then they came to the stable, and as soon as they arrived the girl fed and watered the horse. Then she carefully groomed it. Charlie was surprised. He'd never done any of that for his horse. He saw that the girl spent a lot of time giving care and attention to her horse, and that she did it all on her own. This had never entered into charlie's mind; he had always been too preoccupied with playing and having fun to look after the horse. Charlie wanted to change and become like the girl. As no one had shown him how to do this, he went over to her and asked her to teach him how to look after his horse. After her initial surprise, she happily accepted. With her he learned how to put care and effort into things, and that if you did so you enjoyed them much more. He learned that you could be much happier with only a few special things that you truly cared for and looked after, than with thousands of toys that were only good for a short time and were then thrown aside. But not everything was easy. Charlie also learned that the care put into these things was sometimes difficult, and it needed dedication of time and effort to do it well. So much so, that it even crossed his mind to go back to his old way of treating his horse. However, when the horse finally recovered all its strength and splendour, that first ride, alongside the girl, made him so happy that a doubling of his effort would have been worthwhile. As a result, charlie gave up constantly asking for new toys. Grateful to his friend, he gave her many of his own toys, and more to the children of the village. He only kept those few toys he really liked. And, just as he had learned with the horse, he set himself to repairing and caring for those toys, so he could really enjoy playing with them.
