The class members were a bunch of rather mischievous colours; from black and white, through to red and blue, yellow, and all the rest. They hoped to grow up to be wonderful colours, and this is what they were training for. As well as funny and joyful, the colours were very naughty; particularly black and white, who were so preoccupied with causing mayhem that they were almost always late for class. One morning there was a great commotion in the sky. The clouds were up there, practicing their raining, but they had been raining for so long that they'd gone and created a storm so terrible that absolutely everyone had become saddened and depressed at having so little light. When the sun started shining again, not even that managed to cheer up the world. The only solution was to appeal, as a last resort, to the naughty, mischievous colours, even though they were still very young and weren't yet trained for anything like this. The authorities went straight to their classroom. It was still early, and, as ever, black and white hadn't yet turned up. However, there was no time to lose; they couldn't wait for black and white. The other colours had to do something fast. They ran down the corridors, out of the door, and flew up into the sky, where the clouds - ashamed for what had happened - were waiting. On their way up to the clouds each one of the colours left a resplendent trail. Travelling side by side, the combination of all the colours' trails was so striking and spectacular that smiles returned to everyone's face, and the world filled with the sound of applause. The colours felt honoured and delighted to be named as the sun's official assistants. And the inhabitants of the world begged them to promise that, from that day on, the colours would always be on hand, to help cheer everyone up. It was agreed that whenever the clouds overdid it on the rain, the colours would come quickly and make a rainbow. A bit later, black and white entered the classroom, finding it empty. Everyone was congratulating the other colours so much for their wonderful performance that black and white - really the most fun and happy of all the colours - didn't dare to ask to be part of the rainbow, and from that time onward they forced themselves to be punctual and responsible. Indeed, they managed this so well that now they don't mind being left out of the rainbow.

Every year an absent-minded tourist would fall foul of a great big pinch that made them leave and not want to come back. Scared swimmers would often get together to try and catch the crab but every time they thought they had succeeded, the pinches returned to let them know they had caught the wrong crab. Crazyclaws had a mean streak but he was also very clever. Instead of concealing himself and going unnoticed like all the other crabs, he would hide in the sand and prepare his attack. Crazyclaws was a little resentful because, as a baby crab, he was stepped on by a child and had lost a leg. It grew back but it was shorter than his other legs and he got very angry and upset every time he looked at it. He was thinking about how mean swimmers could be when he spotted his next victim. It was a big fat shiny toe and its owner was barely moving. 'how easy! ' he thought. Now he could pinch with all his strength. He remembered the different steps he had to follow: emerge, move forward, pinch, release, retreat, and disappear into the sand again. Go get'em!! Something went wrong, however. Crazyclaws got stuck on the fourth step and was unable to release the toe. His pinch was so strong that he had broken through the skin and got stuck in the flesh. Flesh? It couldn't be, there was no blood. Only then did crazyclaws realise it was a trap! But crazyclaws was exaggerating as always. He thought that no one could be so smart as to trap him with a fake toe. The fake toe did belong to someone though: a girl called vera, who lost her leg in an accident when she was little. She didn't realise that crazyclaws was attached to her toe until she came out of the water to go and play in the sand. She released the crab, but he didn't run off because he was scared to death. Vera discovered that crazyclaws had a shorter leg and she felt sorry for him, so she decided to help him. She made him a wonderful little house using rocks and fetched him small animals to eat. What a feast! This girl sure can look after a crab. She was happy, fun and - most importantly - she put him back in the sea before leaving. \"What a lovely girl\" He thought that night. \"I'd like to be just as nice as her. if only I didn't have this little leg …\". It was at that moment that he realised that vera's leg had never grown back and that children aren't like crabs. They only have two legs and yet she was still really nice. He could certainly be a happy crab even though he had been through very difficult times. The very next day and every day after that during that summer, crazyclaws attacked vera's toe again so he could play with her all day. Together they learned how to turn pinches into tickles and a bad temper into a laughter and glee. In the end, vera's crab became very famous on that beach, though nobody suspected that it was actually crazyclaws. It was better that way because there were still people who had not learnt that you don't need to be resentful and bad tempered, no matter how badly you are pinched by a crab.

He prepared himself as always: hidden in the bushes, his eyes fixed on the victim, the bow flexed, the arrow ready, waiting for the right moment and…fire! But the arrow didn't pierce the beautiful young girl's heart. Instead, it took a strange, slow and majestic flightpath, and it ended up in the ground, next to some iris flowers of incredible beauty. Jerry, surprised, came over and collected the stupid arrow. But doing so he couldn't help but see the delicate but resplendent flowers, and he felt that he had never seen anything so beautiful…a few minutes later jerry looked again at his intended victim, to load another of his new arrows into his bow.

Sometime later the wand gave ieat a chubby songbird. \"Lucky me! if I eat it now, it will make me happy today.\" The bird tasted so good that the day turned out to be his best in the oasis. Around that time also, iplant's wand gave him a skinny songbird. \"Lucky me! if I feed the bird and take care of it, it will make me happy for many days.\"For many days after that, iplant shared the little food he had with the bird, to get the bird to return and wake him up every morning with beautiful songs. Every now and again, the two wizards received new little gifts from their wands. Ieat used them at once to enjoy a special day, while iplant put up with hunger and tiredness to turn each gift into something that might be useful in future. That way, it didn't take him long to grow a small garden with fruit, which he shared with more and more animals who provided him with assistance, food and company. Eventually he felt so happy and comfortable, and had so many things, that he finally dared to go out and find ieat to try and cross the desert and escape. However, ieat wanted nothing to do with him.

So much so, that when he saw other robots in the street, he would look at them with a certain air of superiority; he reserved his enthusiastic greetings for other xt-27s. \"All robots should be like us xt-27s\", he thought to himself. He was convinced that no new robot would be able to improve on the xt-27 model, and that the world would be a much better place if all robots were like himself.

Finally, he moved into his moulded fibreglass bubble , on the outskirts of the city. The days passed, but he suddenly realised that there was something about that city that he didn't like.

Everyone could do things equally well, which made it impossible for anyone to stand out from the crowd.

That forest was the village's best defence against the storms and furies of the sea, that were so ferocious throughout the region that it was only possible to live where the village was. Yet the forest was constantly in danger, because a small group of wicked beings came every night to cut down some of the trees. The villagers could do nothing to stop the felling, so they were forced to constantly plant new trees to replace the fallen ones. And for generations, such was life for the tree planters. Parents taught their children how to plant, and the children, from a very early age, spent all their free time planting new trees. Each family was responsible for replanting a particular area, and had been since time immemorial. Failure of any family to do this would have brought the community to ruin. Of course, most of the planted trees were lost due to a thousand varying reasons, and only a small percentage reached full growth. But so many were planted that the protective forest managed to maintain its size, despite the great storms and the cruel felling of the evil beings. But then, there was a great misfortune. One of the families died out due to lack of descendents, and their area of the forest began losing more trees. There was nothing to be done, the tragedy was inevitable, and in the village the people prepared to emigrate after so many centuries. Even so, one of the young men refused to abandon the village. -\"I won't go,\" He said, -\"If needed, I will start a new family that will look after that area, and I myself will go to work on it from day one.\"Everyone knew that no one was capable of looking after a replanting area all on their own and, as the forest would take some time to thin out, they accepted the young man's proposal. Yet, by doing so, they had accepted the greatest revolution ever seen in the village. That young man, loved by all, had no trouble in finding people to help him replant. But those helping hands all came from other areas, and soon his own area wasn't the only one in need of extra help and more trees. These new areas were helped by other families and soon no one knew whether they should look after their own area or someone else's: so to simplify things they just planted trees wherever they were needed. But they were needed in so many areas that the villagers began planting even during the night, despite their ancestral fear of the wicked tree cutters. Those nocturnal plantings meant the planters came across some of the fellers, only to discover that those \"Wicked\" Beings were nothing more than the frightened members of a tribe that hid themselves in the labyrinthine cliff caves during the day. They would surface at night to get some wood and food, so they could survive. As soon as these \"Beings\" Got to see how good it was living in a village on the surface, having food and water, and knowing how to plant trees, they begged to be accepted into the village. With each new night, the village gained more hands to help with the planting, and there were fewer cave-dwellers cutting down the trees. Soon, the village filled with grateful \"Night-beings\" Who mixed happily among the old families until they became indistinguishable. And so great was their influence, that the forest began to expand. Day after day, year after year, almost imperceptibly, the forest got bigger and bigger, and it provided more and more protection, until finally the descendants from that village could live anywhere they liked in the region.

This bothered the king so much that he finally ordered it to be cut down and replaced by a beautiful series of fountains. Some time later, a wise noble was visiting the king at his palace.

Without hesitating, he climbed over the castle walls, and followed the voices. \"Anybody here?\" He asked. \"Help! help us!\" Came the response from inside, \"We've been locked in here for years, serving the castle dragon.\" \"Dragon?\" Thought edward, just before an enormous flying flame almost burnt him alive. Edward spun silently around, and addressing the terrible dragon face to face, said: \"It's all right, dragon. I forgive you for what you just did. you probably didn't know it was me.\"The dragon was very surprised at words like these. He never expected anyone to stand up to him, and certainly not in such a brazen manner. \"Prepare to fight, dwarf! I don't give a fig who you are!\" Roared the dragon. \"Wait a moment. well, it's clear that you don't know who I am. I am the guardian of the great crystal sword!\" Continued edward, who - before fighting - was capable of making all sorts of things up. \"You well know that the sword has killed dozens of ogres and dragons, and that if I unsheathe it, it will fly straight into your neck and kill you.\"The dragon had never heard of such a sword, but this frightened him. He certainly didn't like the sound of something cutting his throat. Edward carried on talking. \"In any case, I want to give you a chance to fight me. let's travel to the other side of the world. over there there's a snow-covered mountain, and at the summit there's a great tower. at the top of the tower there's a golden cage where a wizard made this sword. there the sword loses all its power. I'll be there, but will only wait for you for five days.\"On saying that, edward raised a cloud of dust and disappeared. The dragon thought edward had performed some kind of magic, but he had only hidden in some bushes. Wanting to fight with that impudent knight, the dragon quickly flew out of the cave, towards the other side of the world, in a journey which lasted more than a month. When edward was sure the dragon was far away, he came out of his hiding place, entered the castle, and set free all the prisoners inside. Some had been missing for many years, and when they returned home everyone praised edward's great intelligence. And what about the dragon? Well, can you believe that on the other side of the world there was really a snowy mountain with a big tower on top, and a gold cage on top of that? Well yes, the dragon squeezed into the cage and couldn't get out; and there he remains, hoping that someone intelligent will one day come and rescue him… ", "target_text": "Quick thinking is the best weapon of all, and should always be used in preference to violence.

As usual, he was lying on his bed, busy staring at the ceiling, daydreaming. Suddenly some little elves, no more than a centimetre tall, appeared by the window. \"Good evening, young man, will you please give us your homework so we can play with it?\", asked one of the elves, politely.

Charlie watched his guests, and was so surprised to see what they did. In less than a minute, they had formed teams and were busy playing with the pen, the eraser, the book, and the pad of paper. Very strange stuff they were getting up to. Like with the sums, instead of moving the pen across the paper, they would hold the pen still and move the paper instead. Or like how they had races to see who could do the sums fastest. And then they all dressed up as either father christmas, a halloween pumpkin, or a bag of cheese. And whenever the clock was stopped, the elf who was in the lead got to draw himself in the notepad. So the pad ended up full of santas and pumpkins. They were also really funny while learning to read. They used well-known songs, and had to learn the words to them. When they had done that they put on a big concert to sing those songs. Charlie really enjoyed watching those little students, he even joined in with the singing.

He had become lost while traveling with his family, who were looking for a warmer place to spend the winter. When night came, after much time spent looking for them, but with no luck, he took refuge in a small cave he found in the mountainside. Inside the cave there were only a few dry twigs and leaves that had been blown their by the wind. Although feeding himself wasn't a worry, seeing as he had always been so good at it, not knowing whether he would see his loved ones again deeply saddened him. -\"Don't stray far from us when we're migrating,\" His parents had always repeated to him. But he would get so excited at all the little things he would discover during their journeys, and there he would be, open-mouthed, contemplating these wonders, flapping his wings over every new treasure, while the others just carried on with the journey, not noticing his absence. That day, while flying, he had seen a flash of light, a reflection coming out of the trees, and without realising it, he swooped low and approached to see what was the source of the beautiful light. And he discovered an enormous, picturesque lake of crystalline waters; a sight that left him completely surprised. -\"Wow!!\" He exclaimed, seeing himself reflected in the water, -\"How wonderful!!\"He'd never seen anything like it. The sun was beginning to fire its rays onto the water, and these became brilliant golden reflections that almost blinded you. It was a spectacular sight. There he played, flying over the water, playing with his own reflection; using the calm waters as a mirror, viewing the white clouds sliding past overhead. Time passed without him realising, and when he gained altitude and called for his family so he could show them what he'd found, his call went unanswered. His parents and brothers and sisters had continued on with the journey, and they couldn't hear him. Suddenly an enormous fear arose in him. All that beauty disappeared from his eyes, and he could only hear strange noises that increased his fear and his feeling of uneasiness. Cries of strange birds echoed around the forest, and everything that had hitherto seemed beautiful turned into something gloomy and ghostly. The sun now seemed to cast only shade, and he was afraid of being left alone in the forest. He flew out of the trees, in search of his family, but the night came and he was still alone. So then he sought out a place to shelter and pass the night. With the little leaves he found in the cave he made a small nest. It was a bit noisy since the leaves were so dry, but at least it gave him some warmth that night. The following day, when he woke, he didn't remember that he'd become lost, but soon after getting up it all came to mind, and he began worrying. -\"Oh, my god! what will I do here alone? where is my family?\" And he soon found out how much he missed them. His parents had always repeated to him that, if someday he should get lost, what he should do is not go far from the last place they had all been together, put himself in a place that was high enough so he could be seen when they returned, and that he should never allow fear to stop him seeing reality. -\"It's true!!\" He said, remembering this, -\"My parents told me what I would have to do if I get lost, so I have nothing to be afraid of. my family is looking for me right now, and soon we'll be together.\"And so he left his little cave, thanking it for having given him shelter that night. Once again everything outside was beautiful, and the confidence that he would find his family made him fly happily in what was an unknown place for him. Before long he once more found the beautiful lake, and there he found the tallest tree, where he perched himself. While he was waiting he began humming, and gradually the little birds who lived there joined in with him. He told them he was lost, and the birds decided to sing really loudly so that anyone passing would hear them. Soon their song could be heard from very far off, and this helped his family to quickly find him. After that day, our little hummingbird was a bit wiser. Now he knew that he should always let his family know when was going to fly off from them during their travels. He also knew that during the course of his life he would meet others who would offer him their help. And, most important of all, he learned that when fear got the better of him the most beautiful things could come to appear the most terrifying.

Taking out words here and there, he was able to finish the stories a little quicker. However, this still didn't seem enough, so he kept shortening them more and more until, one day, he cut out the most important words of a tale: \"The end\". That night he went to bed peacefully but he woke up feeling rather strange. He got up and when he looked in the mirror he realised that he was wearing a big pirate hat and a black eye-patch and had an enormous red beard with white spots! There was no doubt in his mind: he had been transformed into flamenco beard, the notorious pirate captain from his tales. Worried, he ran to his children's bedrooms. As he opened the door, a great wall of water came crashing down on him and he soon found himself swimming in the middle of the sea. He wasn't alone, however. He was being chased by hungry sharks which had not eaten for weeks. Flamenco beard prepared himself to fight, grabbing the butter knife that he always kept hidden under his hat. Just as he was about to lunge at the first shark, he felt himself being lifted into the air and then dropped onto the deck of a giant pirate ship. \"That was close, captain\" - said a pirate sailor who was the spitting image of his eldest son. \"The captain could've dealt with those clumsy sharks!\" Shouted a couple of cabin boys who were so similar flamenco beard could have sworn they were his twins. There was no time to lose. The captain was told that the queen had been kidnapped and there would be a great reward for whoever rescued her safe and sound. Without a second thought, they set sail to the island of the last cannibal, the favourite spot for all baddies wishing to hide kidnapped queens. They were at full sail when a big, dark storm started to form and, as fate would have it, a bolt of lightning struck the mast of the ship, triggering a massive fire. They were so busy putting out the fire that they didn't realise that an enormous wave had hurled the ship onto the reefs around the island with so much force that the captain and his sailors were sent flying into the air. When the captain woke up, he found himself tied to a big tree trunk. His crew of pirates was tied up next to him. They were in the heart of the island's volcano, the place chosen by the cannibals for their sacrifices and rituals. However, they were not the ones who were going to be eaten. Everything had been put in place to sacrifice a beautiful woman with a crown, who had to be the queen. The cannibals started their chants. How annoying, they always did everything while singing. Then the captain had an idea. With a loud voice, he began to sing pirate songs and all the crew joined in singing at the top of their voices. The cannibals tried to sing louder and, even though there were more of them, they couldn't sing louder than the captain and his men. Without their chants, they couldn't begin the feast so, red in the face with anger, they decided to switch the captain for the queen. Now it was the captain who was hanging above a big pot, about to be cooked. He could feel the burning of the pepper and smell the sauce, and he became so hot that he no longer had the strength to sing. His men were silenced also by the big dollops of chocolate ice cream they were eating with relish. How did those savages know that chocolate ice cream was his crew's weakness? Just then he saw the queen smile, a crooked smile that only withered flower possessed. Clearly, it had all been a trap, set by the fearsome woman pirate captain - once his greatest companion but was now his biggest rival - to capture flamenco beard and his men. Surrounded by cannibals and grimacing at the pain of the first bite, the captain accepted defeat. \"You win, withered flower. this is the end.\"On saying that last word, everything disappeared and the daddy found himself in bed, still scared and sweaty.

His family had a lot of money, and whenever he liked something, they would buy it for him. In reality, then, he had no idea what things cost, and wouldn't bother to take care of what he had. Nor did he realise how difficult it was for other children to get toys like the ones he had. A time came, though, when he was so used to all his toys and various stuff, that he began to want something different. One of his uncles found a fine horse and he gave it to charlie, as something unusual. Charlie was very excited at having a horse. He learned to ride, and was constantly on his horse, going here and there. However, he treated the horse just as badly as he did all his other toys, and it soon started looking neglected and sick. For the first time in his life charlie became truly worried. He loved the horse, and the fact that his family had offered to swap it for a new one meant nothing to him. One day, while in the countryside, he saw a girl with a horse. The girl looked very poor, but the horse seemed happy and looked great. Wondering how she had managed this, charlie secretly followed them, watching everything they did. First he followed them through the forest, where he saw that she never used the whip, and never hit the horse. This was the opposite of what charlie had done to his horse, right from day one. Then they came to the stable, and as soon as they arrived the girl fed and watered the horse. Then she carefully groomed it. Charlie was surprised. He'd never done any of that for his horse. He saw that the girl spent a lot of time giving care and attention to her horse, and that she did it all on her own. This had never entered into charlie's mind; he had always been too preoccupied with playing and having fun to look after the horse. Charlie wanted to change and become like the girl. As no one had shown him how to do this, he went over to her and asked her to teach him how to look after his horse. After her initial surprise, she happily accepted. With her he learned how to put care and effort into things, and that if you did so you enjoyed them much more. He learned that you could be much happier with only a few special things that you truly cared for and looked after, than with thousands of toys that were only good for a short time and were then thrown aside. But not everything was easy. Charlie also learned that the care put into these things was sometimes difficult, and it needed dedication of time and effort to do it well. So much so, that it even crossed his mind to go back to his old way of treating his horse. However, when the horse finally recovered all its strength and splendour, that first ride, alongside the girl, made him so happy that a doubling of his effort would have been worthwhile. As a result, charlie gave up constantly asking for new toys. Grateful to his friend, he gave her many of his own toys, and more to the children of the village. He only kept those few toys he really liked. And, just as he had learned with the horse, he set himself to repairing and caring for those toys, so he could really enjoy playing with them.
